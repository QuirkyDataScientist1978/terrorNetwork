# Analysis of Terror Network.

## Summer Research Program 2018, Koc University, Istanbul, Turkey. 
I was selected for the Summer Research Program at KOC University, Istanbul, Turkey. My project <a href="https://nonstatearmedgroups.ku.edu.tr" target="_blank">Dangerous Companions</a> is an interdisciplinary initiative that focuses on non-state violence, especially the role of terrorism, the Middle East Conflict etc. 

Project is supplied by novel <a href="https://nonstatearmedgroups.ku.edu.tr" target="_blank"> NAG Dataset </a>. My task was focused on Data Visualization using directed graphs, analyzing yearly variations, cycles, and Hypothesis testing. NAG stands for Non-State Armed Groups (terrorists or revolutionaries).
